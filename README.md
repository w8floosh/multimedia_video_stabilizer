# multimedia_video_stabilizer
C# and Python video stabilization software based on the work by Nghia Ho and Adam Spannbauer's vidstab Python library.
University final project in Image Processing.

This is a C# software which embeds a Python runtime using your local Python 3.6>= interpreter to execute Python code from Adam Spannbauer's vidstab library.
Uses shimat's OpenCV wrapper for .NET to implement video stabilization quality assessment algorithms introduced in paper "A performance
evaluation framework for video stabilization methods" by Wilko Guilluy, Azeddine Beghdadi, and Laurent Oudre.
